This post provides background on my time in graduate school, my work there, and the research publications I produced.

# Publication Background
In graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I studied power electronics and worked as a research assistant for Dr. Bulent Sarlioglu within [WEMPEC](https://wempec.wisc.edu/). In my short two years in Madison, I was actively researching the use of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), in various interter and converter topologies. The application of this research was geared toward the the automotive, aerospace, and solar industries.

My research culmitated in the development of a novel three phase inverter topolgy to reduce common mode conducted EMI in motor drives using WBG devices. My responsibilites for this research included everything from the analytical calculations, simulations, and schematic capture (using Altium) to the PWB design, build and test of the entire embedded system. While the research of the inverter topology was ultimately a success, it was during this development that I realized my true passion was in the software development of the embedded system I was creating for the project and not as much in the power electronics aspects. So, with the completion of this project for my Master's thesis, I graduated and began to pursue embedded system jobs.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time in graduate school and work I did related to power electronics. It was a very productive time as I authored or co-authored more than 20 publications for various conferences and journals. A full collection of my work can be found on the IEEE website, available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085343282).

# Selected Papers
While I am proud of all of the research I did in graduate school, I want to highlight two particular papers. These two papers represent my first and the last journal publications, have the most citations among works that I authored, and are in the highest impact factor journals. 

### [_More Electric Aircraft - Review, Challenges and Opportunities for Commercial Transport Aircraft_](/docs/IEEE_TTE_MEA_Sarlioglu.pdf) 

This paper was my first journal paper and was done in close coordination with my advisor, Dr. Sarlioglu, who was a new professor from the aerospace industry. This paper has served has an in-depth review of the current state of electric aircraft and discussion for its future. The final published version can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7098414).

### [_Reduction of Common Mode Voltage and Conducted EMI Through Three Phase Inverter Topology_](/docs/Morris_PELS_Letter_Float_Inverter.pdf) 

This paper is the end result of my thesis work related to a new inverter topology referred to as the "Float Inverter". As opposed to my first journal paper which was largely a review paper with no experiments, this paper describes the development and operation of a novel concept, complete with implementation and experimental data to support the theory. This was a very rewarding project and I was excited for it to be published in the pre-eminent journal for power electronics, **IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics**. The final published version can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7564436).
