The last few Thanksgivings, my go-to dish has been this apple crisp. Apple crisp was not something that was always a staple of my Thanksgivings growing up, but something I always liked and wanted to learn to make. My mom found this recipe in her 30 year old box of recipes and it has been a hit! My in-laws now request is every year!
