Growing up, I was lucky to have no shortage of homecooked meals and desserts at my disposal. All family gatherings were potlucks and the options were always good. This tradition (or habit) was definitely a result of my Grandma Kate and her experience cooking for a family of 10 children. The specialty in my family was undoubtedly desserts; the 27 page cookbook we compiled of my grandma's recipes was 22 pages of desserts!

It was not until I moved away to Madison for grad school that I really appreciated all of the great food I had growing up (mostly because this was the first time I had to cook everyday on my own). I decided I wanted to learn to cook and since have been slowly adding more and more dishes to my arsenal. The dessert skills were definitely genetic (my best and most requested dishes are desserts), but I have also found a few other top favorites. Below are some of the recipes of my favorite dishes to make. Let me know if you have any other recommendations!

### RECIPES
 - [Scotcheroos](#scotcheroos)
 - [Apple Crisp](#apple-crisp)
 - [Pizza](#homemade-emilios-pizza)

## SCOTCHEROOS

Scotcheroos are far and away the most popular dessert in the Morris Family. My mom would make these for almost any type of gathering and they were always a crowd favorite. It has been quite dangerous that I learned to make them myself! My wife credits part of her success in residency to these as she would bring to her preceptors and advisors on a regular basis!

Now, as much as I like to joke that this is a secret family recipe, truth is it was once published on the back of a Rice Crispy cereal box. Below is our spin on the recipe.

### Ingredients
 1. 1 cup of sugar
 2. 1 cup of light corn syrup (Karo)
 3. 1 cup of peanut butter (usually smooth, crunch ok. DO NOT USE fat-free/low-fat peanut butter - consistency will not be correct)
 4. 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels
 5. 1 cup of butterscotch morsels
 6. 6 cups of Rice Crispy Cereal

### Directions
 1. In a large pot, combine sugar and corn syrup and melt on medium heat until boiling (ensure it is boiling!)
 2. Remove heat, add peanut butter until is fully melted in sugar mixture
 3. Add rice crispies and mix well
 4. Spread rice crispy mixture evenly in a 13"x9" pan.
 5. In a separate, microwave safe bowl, combine chocolate and butterscotch chips. Melt in microwave at 50% power setting. Time will vary by microwave, but generally 2.5 minutes or so, mixing every 45 seconds. Spread over rice crispies.
 6. Refridgerate for an hour or more until the chocolate sets completely. Remove from fridge, cut, and serve!

## APPLE CRISP

The last few Thanksgivings, my go-to dish has been this apple crisp. Apple crisp was not something that was always a staple of my Thanksgivings growing up, but something I always liked and wanted to learn to make. My mom found this recipe in her 30 year old box of recipes and it has been a hit! My in-laws now request is every year!

### Ingredients
For the core:
 1. 5-6 apples, cored and sliced
 2. 1 tablespoon of butter
 3. 1 teaspoon cinnamon
 4. 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
 5. 3/4 cup of sugar  

For the crust:
 1. 3/4 cup flour
 2. 1/2 cup sugar
 3. 1/3 cup butter

### Directions
For the core:
 1. Peel, core, and slice apples, spread in glass baking pan
 2. Cut tablespoon of butter into smal pieces and spread over apples
 3. Comine cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar, spread evenly over apples  

For the crust:
 1. Combine flour, sugar, and butter. Work in butter with a fork until combined and crumbly
 2. Cover apples with crumble crust
 3. Bake at 425 until crust is golden brown, 30-45 minutes
 4. Serve with ice cream

## HOMEMADE EMILIO'S PIZZA
![Pizza](/assets/images/pizza_baked.jpg){:height="420px" width="560px"} 

Interestingly, growing up in Central Ohio, I had no shortage of terrific pizza options. When people think of cities associated with pizza, its generally Chicago or New York. While not as popular or well known, Central Ohio can certainly holds its own with those other cities. Pizza is so popular that my hometown had roughly 1 pizza parlor per 1000 residents! However, when it comes to picking the best, there is an undisputed winner: [Emilio's](http://www.emelioscatering.com/restaurant).

Emilio's was a favorite of my father growing up, a trait also passed down to me. It is the pepperoni that sets them far above the rest of pizza options in the area. After decades of searching, asking, begging the owners for the brand of pepperoni, my dad recently was able to buy the pepperoni in bulk directly from the restaurant! Armed with their pepperoni, we were finally able to make the best homemade pizza.

### Ingredients
 1. Martha White Thin & Crispy Pizza Crust
 2. Prego Pizza Sauce 
 3. Kraft Italian Shredded Cheese
 4. Lots and Lots of Pepperoni from Emilios (or a similar thick small pepperoni)

### Directions
The directions for making the pizza are spelled out on the directions of the Marth White pizza crust. Some helpful tips:
 1. Place a pizza stone in the oven while it preheats. Once the crust is initially baked in a different pan, after adding topics to the crust, move the pizza to finish baking on the warm pizza crust.
 2. Use enough sauce to cover entire crust, I use about 1/3 of the jar, roughly 4 or 5 large spoonfuls
 3. Don't be shy with the cheese
 4. Finally, top cheese with the pepperoni, covering every square inch of available space. See image below for idea of how to top the pizza.
