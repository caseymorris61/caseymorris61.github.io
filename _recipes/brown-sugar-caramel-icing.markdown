This Brown Sugar Caramel Icing, aka Penuche Icing, aka Spice Cake Icing, aka Cinnamon Roll Icing is a delicious and all purpose icing that has many uses. I found references to it in quite a few places in the old family cookbooks. Most often used for spice cake or cinnamon rolls, you can't go wrong topping a dessert with it (even a chocolate cake)! Enjoy!

### Ingredients
 1. 1/2 cup of butter
 2. 1 cup of brown sugar, packed
 3. 1/4 cup of milk
 4. 1 3/4 cup of powdered sugar

### Directions
 1. Melt butter
 2. Stir in brown sugar
 3. Bring to boil, and boil for 2 minutes (longer than 2 minutes causes issues later)
 4. Add milk and return to boil (happens very quickly in my experience)
 5. Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm
 6. Add powdered sugar to cool mixture and beat until thick (if too think, add a little hot water). Spread on dessert.
