The cinnamon roll recipe has been passed down through the Londergan Family and is a longtime staple of my Aunts Mavourneen, Ellen, and Kelly. During a recent trip to visit family, Sarah went through my Aunt's cookbook and handpicked some recipes for us to try. This cinnamon roll recipe was the first one of those set that we tried, and they were amazing. They are a bit of work, especially the first time, but are definitely worth it!

The full recipe made roughly 30-35 cinnamon rolls, so would be worthwhile to make just half.

## Enriched Dough

### Ingredients
 1. 3/4 cup of margarine (or lard)
 2. 1 cup of boiling water
 3. 2 eggs beaten
 4. 3/4 cup of sugar
 5. 2 teaspoons of salt
 6. 1 cup of cold water
 7. 2 packages of dry yeast (not instant yeast)
 8. 1/2 cup of lukewarm water (100-110 degrees)
 9. 7.5 cups of flour

### Directions
 1. Combine margarine and boiling water; stir until melted
 2. In separate large mixing bowl, combine eggs, sugar, and salt
 3. Beat in cold water to egg/sugar mixture
 4. In third bowl, soften yeast in lukewarm water (as instructed on package)
 5. Combine 3 mixtures, add flour, and mix well/knead the dough. At this point, it can be refrigerated 8 hours while covered

 1. 12-16 tablespoons of margarine
 2. Lots of cinnamon and sugar

### Directions
 1. Soften butter (about 5 seconds in microwave)
 2. Mix in cinnamon sugar

## Cinnamon Rolls

2. Roll out dough to size/shape of large cutting board
3. Cover dough with cinnamon sugar filling
4. Roll dough tightly, and slice

5. Place in baking pan and let dough rise until double in bulk (we did roughly 75 minutes)
6. Bake at 400F for 12-15 minutes until golden 
7. Let cool and top with icing of choice. [Brown Sugar Caramel Icing](/recipes/brown-sugar-caramel-icing/) recommended (use 2X the incredients if doing full cinnamon role batch). Enjoy!
