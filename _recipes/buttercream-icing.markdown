Towards the end of 2020, we were on quite a binge of The Great British Bake Off. During one technical challenge, they were asked to make [Mini Swiss Rolls](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/prue-leith-chocolate-mini-rolls/). This is inspired by the filling used in that recipe and works great for cakes, cookies, really anything!

### Ingredients
 1. 10 tablespoons of butter
 2. 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
 3. 1 teaspoon vanilla (or other flavoring like peppermint)

### Directions
 1. Beat the butter in a bowl with a wooden spoon, until soft
 2. In a mixer, slowly add powdered sugar to mixture
 3. Add vanilla and continue beating on medium speed until white, soft, and fluffy.
