Scotcheroos are far and away the most popular dessert in the Morris Family. My mom would make these for almost any type of gathering and they were always a crowd favorite. It has been quite dangerous that I learned to make them myself! My wife credits part of her success in residency to these as she would bring to her preceptors and advisors on a regular basis!

Now, as much as I like to joke that this is a secret family recipe, truth is it was once published on the back of a Rice Crispy cereal box. Below is our spin on the recipe.

### Ingredients
 1. 1 cup of sugar
 2. 1 cup of light corn syrup (Karo)
 3. 1 cup of peanut butter (usually smooth, crunch ok. DO NOT USE fat-free/low-fat peanut butter - consistency will not be correct)
 4. 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels
 5. 1 cup of butterscotch morsels
 6. 6 cups of Rice Crispy Cereal

### Directions
 1. In a large pot, combine sugar and corn syrup and melt on medium heat until boiling (ensure it is boiling!)
 2. Remove heat, add peanut butter until is fully melted in sugar mixture
 3. Add rice crispies and mix well
 4. Spread rice crispy mixture evenly in a 13"x9" pan.
 5. In a separate, microwave safe bowl, combine chocolate and butterscotch chips. Melt in microwave at 50% power setting. Time will vary by microwave, but generally 2.5 minutes or so, mixing every 45 seconds. Spread over rice crispies.
 6. Refridgerate for an hour or more until the chocolate sets completely. Remove from fridge, cut, and serve!
