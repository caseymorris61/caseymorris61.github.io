One of my hobbies is reading. I like all different types of books: biographies, historical non-fiction, fantasy novels, crime/law novels, business books, etc. When I start a book, I generally dont stop until I finish it. I may go weeks without reading a book, but then finish a few in 2 or 3 weeks. Was this considered the original form of binging?

I wanted to keep a list of books I have read recently, both to keep a running catalog of books read and my initial impressions and also to motivate myself to keep adding titles to the list. I read almost exclusively on Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. Special thanks to the free e-books available at the public libraries in the past cities I have lived: Columbus, Dallas, Menlo Park, and Memphis.

If you have any recommendations for books I may enjoy, please let me know!

## 2019 Books Read

 1. *Origin* - Dan Brown. I have been a fan of Dan Brown since I read *Da Vinci Code* and *Angels and Demons* in high school. I find character Robert Langdon enjoyable to follow around, but this book wasn't his best but I found myself curious how it would end (and it lived up to the expectation of a completely ridiculous ending). Seemed like a lot of unnecessary shots at organized religion, which I didn't really appreciate.
 2. *The Fallen* - David Baldacci. Book 4 in the Amos Decker series, following the life of ex-football player, ex-detective turned FBI consultant Amos Decker and his perfect recall solving high profile murders. I find the writing style enjoyable and the characters interesting. Only complaint is the forced use of football metaphors/football talk that, while accurate, doesn't come off as realistic.
 3. *All The Pieces Matter* - Author. This is the oral history of the creation and making of the hit HBO series, *The Wire*. This was a fascinating show at a fascinating time, and the stories from the creators, producers, and actors are incredible. Any fan of the TV series will love this.
 4. *Sapiens* - Nori Yoiodsia. This book describes the evolution of homosapiens. It is full of detail and history regarding human develop, which I found interesting (espeically the idea of language and gossiping), but more often than not, I found myself falling asleep while reading. Not for me, at least at this time.
 5. *Bad Blood* - John Carreyou. This is one of my favorites. An absolutely incredible story of Elizabeth Holmes and her fraud Theranos. Her ability to keep the business alive and going for as long as she did is quite remarkable, but also speaks to some of the ridiculousness around venture capital and silicon valley. She was a master of trading in the credibility someone gave her (like Stanford, or her former advisor), and keep turning that credibility into more and more power through connections (General Mattis, Sec. of State George Schulz, etc) but no evidence or results. 
 6. *Hillbilly Elegy*
 7. *Kite Runner*
 8. *The Only Rule Is It Has To Work*
 9. *Redemption*
 10. *Liar's Poker*
 11. *A Gentleman In Moscow*
